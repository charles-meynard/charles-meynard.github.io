Welcome to my webpage ! I am currently a PhD student at the applied mathematic department (CMAP) of Ecole Polytechnique. I am scheluded to Defend my thesis in Autumn 2025 and am currently looking for a postdoc. You can find my resume [here](https://charles-meynard.github.io/files/resume.pdf)

Research interest
======
My research focus for now on the link between (possibly mean field) Forward-Backward Stochastic differential equation and non-linear hyperbolic systems. Mainly with motivations coming from mean field games and mean field control problems. 


Publications
======
1. Noise through an additional variable for mean field games master equation on finite state space, With Charles Bertucci. [Arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05635)
1. A study of common noise in mean field games, With Charles Bertucci. [Arxiv preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12741)
